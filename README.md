# TrainTime
app built using Firebase and .moment() methods

the challenge was to take data from a form and store it where it could be accessed and then manipulated using .moment()

Created a UI that was easy to follow to allow the user to submit info on trains (time of arrival, name, etc)

this info was then stored in firebase and pulled out using snapshot

.moment() methods were deployed to take time of first train departure and calculate the time of the next arrival on this train based on
its interval time.

delete button was added dynaimcally to UI to allow user to remove the specific train they were selecting
